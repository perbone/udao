     * make sense. ANY Not supported. You probably want ONE instead. ONE Will return the record
     * returned by the first node to respond. A consistency check is always done in a background
     * thread to fix any consistency issues when ConsistencyLevel.ONE is used. This means subsequent
     * calls will have correct data even if the initial read gets an older value. (This is called
     * readï¿½repair.) QUORUM Will query all nodes and return the record with the most recent
     * timestamp once it has at least a majority of replicas reported. Again, the remaining replicas
     * will be checked in the background. ALL Will query all nodes and return the record with the
     * most recent timestamp once all nodes have replied. Any unresponsive nodes will fail the
     * operation.
